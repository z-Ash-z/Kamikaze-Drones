## Introduction
  
  Our team will be using ‘Kamikaze Drones’ as the project code name to help protect Acme’s secret product plans. The name means ‘Divine Wind’ in Japanese and is inspired from the ‘[Kamikaze swarm operation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d28APIfwSI)’ by company ‘STM’.

  In this proposal, our team has focused on implementing one of the trending applications of swarm drones, which is to form different geometric shapes using a swarm of 20 or more drones.

  In order to achieve this, state-of-art path-planning swarm algorithms will be deployed. The performance validation of this project will be done using the Gazebo simulation depicting a real-time demo of the application. Acme can then utilize this package in its 5-year robotics-based product roadmap.

## System Design

### Development methodology

  Agile software development model will be used for the development process where tasks will be tracked using a backlog table. The software is designed in a Test-Driven Development fashion and implemented using Pair programming technique. The tasks will be outlined for every sprint and after each sprint, the roles of the pair-programming group will be interchanged.

## Development process
  - Using the Software Engineering Practices, all design and development work was followed Agile Iterative Process (AIP) where product backlog, iteration backlog, and work log were maintained usign appropriate measure. The Sheet can be accessed [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fHZmI5XlFYrR_24ZgUXfHm7kWQuyqo2a178b-_H9M2g/edit?usp=sharing)
  - Each sprint's notes and reviews have been documented [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rGsBwGwRbpP7cR_gu-ueWbK_iysQTQdyqjFzTM7u1lA/edit?usp=sharing)
  
### System architecture
